### **Option 2: Full HeyGen Integration**
1. **Get HeyGen API credentials**:
   - Sign up at https://app.heygen.com/
   - Get API key and Avatar ID
   
2. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AVATAR_ID=your_actual_avatar_id
   ```

3. **Restart frontend**:
   ```bash
