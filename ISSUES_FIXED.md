// Updated DEFAULT_CONFIG with proper voice settings
{
  quality: AvatarQuality.Medium,
  voice: {
    rate: 1.0,
    emotion: VoiceEmotion.FRIENDLY,
  },
  voiceChatTransport: VoiceChatTransport.WebRTC,
  sttProvider: STTProvider.Deepgram,
}
```

## ✅ Issue 2: Buggy and Poor Loader

### Problem
- Loading animations were inconsistent and unprofessional
- Multiple competing spinners creating visual confusion
- Loading states didn't provide clear progress indication

### Root Cause Analysis

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Professional Loading Design
- **Single, Clean Spinner**: Eliminated competing animations

- **Branded Messaging**: Professional loading messages aligned with company branding
- **Smooth Transitions**: Eliminated jarring visual changes

#### 2. Enhanced Loading States
```typescript
// Improved loading screen with progress indication
<div className="w-full bg-secondary-200 rounded-full h-2 mb-4">
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-500 to-primary-700 h-2 rounded-full animate-pulse" 
       style={{ width: sessionState === StreamingAvatarSessionState.CONNECTING ? '75%' : '25%' }}>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 3. Contextual Loading Messages

## ✅ Issue 3: Video Glitches and Zoom Issues

### Problem
- Avatar video would glitch and change zoom unexpectedly
- Container height changes as chat messages increased
- Inconsistent video sizing affecting user experience

### Root Cause Analysis
- Dynamic height containers causing video element resizing
- Chat interface expanding affecting parent container dimensions
- Missing fixed dimensions for video stability

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Height Architecture
```typescript
// Fixed container heights to prevent dynamic resizing
<div className="h-[calc(100vh-16rem)]"> // Fixed main container
  <div className="h-full w-full" style={{ height: 'calc(100vh - 20rem)' }}> // Fixed video container
```

#### 2. Stable Video Container
- **Absolute Dimensions**: Fixed pixel-perfect video container sizing
- **Isolation**: Video container isolated from chat interface changes
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains aspect ratio across different screen sizes

#### 3. Enhanced Video Styling
- **Object-fit**: Proper video scaling with `object-cover`
- **Smooth Transitions**: Eliminated jarring size changes
- **Professional Overlays**: Stable overlay elements unaffected by video changes

### Results
- ✅ Stable video display without glitches
- ✅ Consistent zoom level regardless of chat activity
- ✅ Professional video presentation
- ✅ Smooth user experience without visual interruptions
