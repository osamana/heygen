## System Architecture & Methodology

### Core Components

#### 1. **Frontend Interface** (Next.js)
- **Real-time streaming avatar** using HeyGen SDK
- **Interactive chat interface** supporting both voice and text
- **Connection management** with status indicators
- **Responsive design** optimized for professional use

#### 2. **Backend Intelligence** (FastAPI + Python)
- **Custom RAG pipeline** powered by ChromaDB vector database
- **AI Agent system** with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- **Function calling capabilities** for business actions (appointments, emails)
- **Document ingestion system** for knowledge base updates

#### 3. **Knowledge Base** (ChromaDB + Embeddings)
- **Vector storage** using ChromaDB for persistent data
- **Semantic embeddings** via sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Intelligent chunking** (800 tokens with 150 overlap)
- **Source attribution** for transparency

### Data Flow Process

```
User Question ‚Üí Avatar Interface ‚Üí Backend RAG System ‚Üí Knowledge Retrieval 
     ‚Üì                                                            ‚Üì
Avatar Response ‚Üê Synthesized Answer ‚Üê Relevant Context ‚Üê Vector Search
```

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Input Processing**: User asks question via voice or text
2. **Embedding Generation**: Question converted to vector representation
3. **Similarity Search**: ChromaDB finds top 5 most relevant knowledge chunks
4. **Context Assembly**: Relevant information compiled with source tracking
5. **Response Synthesis**: Intelligent answer generation in receptionist style
